# Tricky Corner

If the square is going up, each click rotates the square to the left 

If the square is going down, each click rotates the square to the right

Collecting yellow squares earns the player points and can rotate the square in the opposite direction

If the player goes outside the dark red area, player loses all points and the game returns to the beginning
